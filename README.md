# How to run tests

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mtshrmn/234124-ex5-tests ex5test
$ cd ex5test
$ cp <PATH TO ex5.py> .
$ python -m pytest
```

### Disclaimer
Those tests were randomly generated


### Troubleshooting

- Pytest isn't installed
```sh
$ python -m pytest
/usr/bin/python: No module named pytest

```
Install pytest using pip (**make sure pip is installed**)
```sh
$ python -m pip install pytest
```
